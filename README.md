# DRC Explorer Robot

Welcome to the DRC Explorer Robot repository! This project showcases a versatile robot designed for exploring environments, detecting walls and other barriers, and efficiently navigating towards colored boxes. The robot employs a PID controller to monitor and control its motion. Equipped with an Arduino board and an L298N Driver driving two DC motors, the DRC Explorer Robot is capable of precision movements to fulfill its mission.
